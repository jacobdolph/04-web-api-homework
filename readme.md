# Overview
This is a quiz game based on a series of questions the user should be able to answer if they have completed the 3rd and 4th week of the university of utah coding bootcamp.

In this assignment I learned how to create a timer and create a list of questions stored in an object and put into an array.

## Instructions

the game will begin once the start game button is clicked

once the timer reaches zero the clock will reset back to 3 minutes and the game will be over.

This week was tough, I had big projects for work that were competing for my time.
